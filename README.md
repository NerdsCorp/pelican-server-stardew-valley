# Stardew Valley Pterodactyl Server 

This repository contains the files needed to spin up a Stardew Valley multiplayer server for pterodactyl.

Use the egg file and set the Steam varialbes. The scripts will remotely grab necessary files. The nexus API for mods doesn't allow downloading without a premium account, so the necessary mods here in this repository and will be pulled into the server on installation.
