# Stardew Valley Server for Pelican panel and Pterodactyl panel

This repository contains the files needed to spin up a Stardew Valley multiplayer server for pterodactyl and pelican.

Use the egg file and set the Steam varialbes. The scripts will remotely grab necessary files. The nexus API for mods doesn't allow downloading without a premium account, so the necessary mods here in this repository and will be pulled into the server on installation.

This is based on both https://github.com/metrogamelab/pterodactyl-server-stardew-valley and https://github.com/pelican-eggs/games-steamcmd/tree/main/starbound. I just modifyed it to pull from my repository and i fixed a few of the broken things and updating the mods because it is unknown why the old reposotory is dead.
